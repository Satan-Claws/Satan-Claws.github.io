# Problem Solving

I've always been interested in trying out different puzzles and I've dabbled a bit in contests with some success, some of them being:

- JEE Advanced (2020) Mathematics 130/132
- Qualified for ICPC Chennai and Amritapuri Regionals (2025) (TBD)
- ICPC Regionals Rank 51 Chennai Site (2024)
- Simon Marais Mathematics Competition [SMMC] (2023) - 4th All India Rank, 38th Global East
- Specialist on Codeforces
- Madhava Mathematics Competition [MMC] (2023) - 6th All India Rank
- Regional Mathematical Olympiad [RMO] (2018, 2019)
- Awarded Shriram Scholarship with full tuition fee waiver and stipend (2020, 2023)
- KVPY-SA (2020) Stage-1
- AMC12A and 12B Honor Roll of Distinction and 3rd Rank in India (2020)
- SAT (2019) Mathematics 800/800


Throughout my problem-solving journey, I've noticed some interesting patterns and created some original problems. I used to post them on Brilliant.org, but the website changed its format and no longer has user-posted content. So I decided I'll put my original problems here.

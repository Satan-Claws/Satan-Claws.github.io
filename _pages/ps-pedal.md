For a triangle $ \Delta $, let its pedal triangle be $ P_1 $ and let $ P_n $'s pedal triangle be $ P_{n+1} $.

Call $ \Delta $ "P-Similar" if even any one of $ P_1, P_2, P_3, P_4, P_5, P_6, P_7, P_8, \ldots $ is similar to $ \Delta $.

How many trios of $(a, b, c)$ exist for $(a, b, c)$ being integers and $a \leq b \leq c$ such that a triangle with angles $a, b, c$ is "P-Similar"?

Angles are measured in degrees.

For clarification, Pedal Triangle here refers to the Orthic-Pedal triangle.

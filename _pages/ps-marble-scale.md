Given a weighing scale that indicates the relationship $(<, >, =)$ between weights placed on both sides:

Your task is to identify the weight of a marble with an unknown integer weight within the range $[1, n]$.

Using the scale, you can choose your own set of integer dummy weights to compare and identify the marble's weight. Determine the smallest set of dummy weights needed to accurately determine the marble's weight.

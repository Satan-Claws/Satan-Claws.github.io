A sequence $S_n$ of whole numbers for natural $n$ is defined as

$S_1=1$

$$ S_n = 
\begin{cases} 
S_{n-1} + n, & \text{if } S_{n-1} < n \\
S_{n-1} - n, & \text{if } S_{n-1} \geq n 
\end{cases}$$

For example, $S_2 = 3$ and $S_3 = 0$ .

Another sequence of increasing natural numbers $C_k$ for natural $k$ for which $S_{C_k} = 0$. Find $C_7$

I am a Final Year Computer Science Master's Student at Chennai Mathematical Institute. I am being advised by Prof M.K. Srivas and Prof. M. Praveen . 

My research interests lie broadly in Optimization, Statistics, Formal Methods, Machine Learning, and the intersections between them.

Currently I've joined as an Operations Research Scientist at Lyric.

Previously, I worked as a Quantitative Research Intern at True Beacon, an Asset Management Firm based in Bengaluru. Here, I worked on Factor Model Research in the Indian Markets and Mutual Fund selection algorithms.

In Summer of 2024, I was a Research Intern at LiVe Lab, a joint lab between Masaryk University and Technical University of Munich under Prof Jan Křetínský. We studied LTL synthesis to create winning policies using ML heuristics.

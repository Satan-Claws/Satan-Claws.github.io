I am a Final Year Computer Science Master's Student at Chennai Mathematical Institute. I am being advised by Prof M.K. Srivas. 

My research interests lie broadly in Statistics, Formal Methods, Machine Learning, and the intersections between them.

Currently, I am working as a Quantitative Research Intern at True Beacon, an Asset Management Firm based in Bengaluru. Here, I am working on Factor Model Research in the Indian Markets.

In Summer of 2024, I was a Research Intern at LiVe Lab, a joint lab between Masaryk University and Technical University of Munich under Prof Jan Křetínský. We studied LTL synthesis to create winning policies using ML heuristics.
